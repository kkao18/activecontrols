# Princeton Rocketry â€“ Active Controls (Thrust Vector Control)

## Overview
This project is part of the **Princeton Rocketry Clubâ€™s Active Controls subteam**, where we design, build, and test a thrust vector control (TVC) system for high-power model rockets. The TVC allows the rocket to dynamically adjust its thrust direction during flight, improving stability and control.

## My Role
- **Team Lead (Jun 2025 â€“ Present):**  
  - Direct testing, refinement, and launch of the TVC system, including live-fire tests.  
  - Implement a structured cycle of goal-setting, planning, execution, and review to grow the subteam.  
  - Lead recruitment and revitalize engagement to expand membership and technical capabilities.  

- **Mechanical Team Member (Aug 2024 â€“ May 2025):**  
  - Led CAD modeling and design of the TVC motor mount, reducing mount size by 20% compared to prior versions.  
  - Designed, prototyped, and tested a black powder parachute ejection system using Fusion360 and 3D-printed components.  
  - Collaborated with electronics/software subteams to integrate IMU feedback and closed-loop control.  

## Technical Highlights
- **CAD & Design Tools:** SolidWorks, Fusion360, KiCad
- **Fabrication:** 3D printing, heat-set inserts, precision assembly  
- **Integration:** Work with electronics and software for real-time control  
- **Testing:** Black powder testing of parachute ejection system

## Future Work and Goals
- Complete first-semester launch with TVC system  
- Enhance control algorithms and system robustness  
- Explore modular actuator design for field servicing  
- Increase subteam visibility and recruit new members
